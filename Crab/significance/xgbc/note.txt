For further research a theta ** 2 cut from 0.10 is used. Under the cut I don't 
realy know if the estimator does some confusing things. I loose if the plot is 
right some singnificance but i can be sure that the estimator is learned on 
testset with fewer hadrons and don't have to regulaize that much that without 
a cut.
